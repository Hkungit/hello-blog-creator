# Local TinyMCE Files

This directory contains local TinyMCE files for the blog editor. 
The files should be downloaded from https://www.tiny.cloud/get-tiny/self-hosted/ 
and extracted here to avoid the "This domain is not registered with TinyMCE Cloud" warning.

Required files:
- tinymce.min.js
- themes/
- skins/
- icons/
- plugins/
- langs/zh_CN.js

Use the downloaded files instead of CDN to avoid domain registration issues.
